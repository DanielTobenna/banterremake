retirement and who seek steady growth but are willing to

those available from a high street deposite account, although the

strategy would feel uncomfortable if their investments rose and
fell in value rapidly. This strategy will maintain a broad spread of
investments, including higher exposure to less volatile asset
classes such as money market funds, government bonds and
absolute return strategies to help guard against significant falls in
equity markets. <br>
