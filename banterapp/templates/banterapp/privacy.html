                        understand how we use the information we collect from you and your choices in how we manage your

                    </p>
                    <p>We may make content or services from other websites, including our affiliated or

                    <p class="lead">Following are the specifics of how we protect your privacy.
                        When You Visit www.cooperhoystedsinvestmentservice.com</p>
                    <p>Our server automatically recognizes the IP address of visitors. This information helps us
                        evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our websites, including the number
                        and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits. Our
                        goal in aggregating and analyzing user data is to improve the site experience for the user and
                        target relevant advertising messaging and content to appropriate interests.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Our Policy on "Cookies"</p>
                    <p>www.cooperhoystedsinvestmentservice.com uses cookies and similar technologies when you use our websites and related web
                        pages.</p>
                    <p class="lead">What are cookies?</p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies are small text files, which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you
                        first visit a site or page. The cookie will help our website, or another website, to recognize
                        your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same
                        thing. We use the term "cookies" in this policy to refer to all files that collect information
                        in this way. We only use cookies in accordance with applicable law.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Cookies serve many functions. For example, they help us to remember your login data,
                        authentication data, and other essential information. Cookies also help us to remember
                        nonessential information such as your preferences, analyze how well our website is performing,
                        or recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Certain cookies contain personal data. For example, if you click to "remember me" when logging
                        in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies
                        you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our
                        website, or a user’s general location.
                        What sort of cookies and other tracking technologies do we use?
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Generally, our cookies and similar tracking technologies perform the following different
                        functions:
                        <br/>
                        <br>

                        Essential/Required Cookies: These cookies are essential for the core operation of our website
                        and are automatically enabled when you use the website.
                        Performance Cookies: These cookies help to improve the performance of the website and provide a
                        better user experience. This allows us to provide you with a high quality experience by
                        customizing our website and content to your interests. Performance cookies also help us quickly
                        identify and fix any issues that arise. For example, we use performance cookies to keep track of
                        which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to
                        determine why some pages are producing error messages.
                        Online Behavioral Cookies: These cookies are used by RaymondConic, our online engagement
                        software. The RaymondConic Services Platform progressively builds an individual customer profile
                        across several channels, from first touch of an anonymous visitor building up to a known
                        customer in a CRM system, with all real-time channel switches and necessary identity transfers
                        and mergers in between. This allows us to dynamically segment these individuals based on their
                        profiles. Then the KuveraInvest Services Platform serves the most relevant content on our website
                        or initializes online interactions.
                        Other Tracking Technologies: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, video, analytics or
                        customer support service providers also use beacons, tags, and scripts to analyze trends,
                        administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and gather demographic
                        information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these
                        technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
